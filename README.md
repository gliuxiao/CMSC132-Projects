# Web-Spider-Project
// add more details about threading/queue
This project utilizes threading to process items on webpages, such as links and images. Images in a webpage are loaded into a queue, and displayed in a slideshow, while links are loaded into a queue which are then processed and opened. The cycle continues until there are no more images to display, or no more links to open.
